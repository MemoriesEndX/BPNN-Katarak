# BPNN-Katarak
This repository contains a project for cataract detection using a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN). The project applies machine learning techniques to analyze input features and predict the presence of cataracts, a common eye condition that can lead to blindness if untreated. This system can assist in automating cataract detection and improve the efficiency of diagnosis.

Key Features
Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN):
Implements a supervised learning algorithm to train the model for cataract detection.
Uses backpropagation for error correction and optimizing weights.
Input Features:
Accepts medical or imaging data (e.g., numerical data from eye examinations or features extracted from images).
Training and Testing:
Includes a dataset for training and testing the model's accuracy.
Performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) are calculated to evaluate the model.
Customizable Parameters:
Allows configuration of parameters like the number of layers, nodes, learning rate, and activation functions.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for implementation.
TensorFlow/Keras: Frameworks for neural network modeling (if used).
NumPy & Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and result analysis.
